> **Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix m[ ][ ] of order n and has to reach the destination at (n-1, n-1). The task is to find a sorted array of strings denoting all the possible directions which the rat can take to reach the destination at (n-1, n-1). The directions in which the rat can move are ‘U'(up), ‘D'(down), ‘L’ (left), ‘R’ (right).**

Example :
```
Input : N = 4 
1 0 0 0 
1 1 0 1 
0 1 0 0 
0 1 1 1
Output :
DRDDRR
```
