> **Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine if the graph can be coloured with at most m colours such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color. Here coloring of a graph means the assignment of colors to all vertices.**

```
Input:  
graph = {0, 1, 1, 1},
        {1, 0, 1, 0},
        {1, 1, 0, 1},
        {1, 0, 1, 0}
Output: 
Solution Exists: 
Following are the assigned colors
 1  2  3  2
Explanation: By coloring the vertices 
with following colors, adjacent 
vertices does not have same colors
```
```
Input: 
graph = {1, 1, 1, 1},
        {1, 1, 1, 1},
        {1, 1, 1, 1},
        {1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: Solution does not exist.
Explanation: No solution exits.
```
Input-Output format: 
```
Input: 

A 2D array graph[V][V] where V is the number of vertices in graph and graph[V][V] is an adjacency matrix representation of the graph. A value graph[i][j] is 1 if there is a direct edge from i to j, otherwise graph[i][j] is 0.
An integer m is the maximum number of colors that can be used.

Output: 

An array color[V] that should have numbers from 1 to m. color[i] should represent the color assigned to the ith vertex. The code should also return false if the graph cannot be colored with m colors.
