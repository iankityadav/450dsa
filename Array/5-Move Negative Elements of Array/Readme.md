> **Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with constant extra space**

An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.

**Note:** Order of elements is not important here.

Example :
```
Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5
```
