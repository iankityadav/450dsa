> **Given an array of integers. Find the Inversion Count in the array. Two array elements arr[i] and arr[j] form an inversion if arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j.**

Example:

```
Input: arr[] = {8, 4, 2, 1}
Output: 6
Explanation: Given array has six inversions: (8, 4), (4, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1).
```

```
Input: arr[] = {1, 20, 6, 4, 5}
Output: 5
Explanation: Given array has five inversions: (20, 6), (20, 4), (20, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5).
```
