> **Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, then we cannot move through that element. If we canâ€™t reach the end, return -1.**

Examples: 
```
Input:  arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 8 -> 9)
Explanation: Jump from 1st element to 
2nd element as there is only 1 step, 
now there are three options 5, 8 or 9. 
If 8 or 9 is chosen then the end node 9 
can be reached. So 3 jumps are made.
```
```
Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 10
Explanation: In every step a jump is 
needed so the count of jumps is 10.
```

<summary>Hint</summary>

- Use three variables
    1. jumps =  jumps taken, this will be our answer
    2. maxrange = maximum range upto which we can jump
    3. steps = to store steps that we can take for a particular jump
